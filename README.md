## README.md

This repository contains code for the shiny app located at https://yli3.shinyapps.io/openfda-ddp33.

Note: I didn't realize the instructions had asked for a Github repository containing the server/UI code as well, so this is a little late -- but it matches the shiny app and is unmodified. Grade as you wish; this was my mistake.
